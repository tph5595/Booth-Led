# Mus
Mus is a music analyzer that reacts to the beets in your favorite songs. It was designed to be deployed in a sound technitions booth with an array of leds lighting up every corner of the room. The electronic board was deisnged to take studio grade XLR as input and the code is designed to be run off of a standard Aruino Uno!
